# Online-Voting-System
The Online Voting System is implemented using a three-tier architecture consisting of 
Frontend Backend and Database. The frontend backend system allows for abstraction by 
separating the different parts of the system. The frontend generally refers to the user 
interface of the system and the backend deals with the business logic which is carried out 
using the data collected. The frontend deals with the visuals and user interface. From a 
developer point of view, it is simply the design of the webpage and the program logic that 
aids in the same. For this, we make use of web languages such as HTML, Javascript and 
CSS. The backend consists of the server-side of the website and is accessed by the users 
using the front-end application. Java classes are used for backend development. The 
backend development is facilitated by the use of Spring framework which consists of many 
modules and provides a basic structure to work on. Spring boot is a spring module which 
simplifies the use of the framework for Java development. Spring Initializer creates a basic 
structure upon which we can develop the main business logic. Database is managed with 
the help of MySQL. A database is a well organised assembly of data for hassle free data 
management. Structured Query Language is most commonly used for handling data in a 
database. The spring framework provides the structure to integrate all the three layers. 

Installation and Requirements:

Java 11 and Spring Boot 3.0.0 are required for running the system.
